            <p class="description">
                Data can capture a snapshot of the world and allow us to understand ourselves and our communities better. With ever-increasing amounts of data deeply immersed in our lives,  the ability to understand and communicate data is now becoming essential for everyone. Visualization leverages our visual perception to provide a powerful yet accessible way to make sense of large and complex data. It has been widely adopted across different disciplines, from science and engineering to business and journalism, to combat the overabundance of information in our society.
                <br/><br/>
                In this course, students will learn foundational knowledge about how to design effective visualizations for analysis and presentation based on theories and principles from graphic design, perceptual psychology, and cognitive science. Students will also learn practical skills about how to rapidly explore and communicate data using <a href="https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/download" target="_blank">Tableau</a> and build interactive visualization products (e.g., articles, tools, and systems) using web-based frameworks including <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/" target="_blank">Vega-Lite</a>.

                <strong>Final Project</strong>
                <p>
                    The culmination of this course is the final project in which students build creative visualization products of their own interests. Students are required to present their work in the class and write up a final report in a conference abstract format. An exceptional project will be encouraged to submit to the <a href="https://chi2020.acm.org/authors/late-breaking-works/" target="_blank">Late-Breaking Works track</a> in ACM CHI.
                    Please find more information about the final project <a href="fp.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

                <h2 class="title">Grading</h2>
                <p>A student’s grade will be based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Readings - 5%</li>
                    <li>Labs - 10%</li>
                    <li>Homeworks 30% (1: 8%, 2: 12%, 3: 25%)</li>
                    <li>Final Project - 40%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A letter grade is assigned based on the following guideline (A is excellent; B is good; C is satisfactory; D is passing but unsatisfactory; F is failure):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A: 100-95%; A-: 90-95%</li>
                    <li>B+: 85-90%; B: 80-85%; B-: 75-80%</li>
                    <li>C+: 70-75%; C: 65-70%; C-: 60-65%</li>
                    <li>D+: 55-60%; D: 50-55%: D-: 45-50%</li>
                    <li>F &lt 45%</li>

                <p>
                    <strong>No laptop policy</strong><br>
                    Students may not use laptops, tablets, phones or other electronic devices during the lectures except when explicitly asked to do so. There is plenty of evidence that multitasking incurs a high cognitive cost in memory and attention (<a href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/august24/multitask-research-study-082409.html" target="_blank">ref</a>), 
                    students who take notes on laptops may learn less than those who take notes on paper (<a href="http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/21/0956797614524581" target="_blank">ref</a>),
                    laptops adversely impact not only the people using them, but also those around them (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131512002254?np=y" target="_blank">ref</a>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Mandatory attendance</strong><br>
                    A lot of learning in this course happens through various activities in both lectures and labs. Not only attending but also being on time is crucial. 
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Late submission</strong><br>
                    Lab, homework, and project submissions after respective deadlines are <strong>not accepted</strong>. Under special circumstances such as medical conditions, family issues, or job interviews, we will allow lab submissions without penalty. Please contact the instructor or TA for such situations. We may require proof of evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Regrade policy</strong><br>
                    Fair and transparent grading is important. Please contact us know if you think there is an error or unreasonable deduction in your assignment. Only regrading requests within 7 days after the initial grade are accepted.

                <p>
                    It is our intention that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socio-economic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.
